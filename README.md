### 2. **Dynamic Print Statements**
   - Print statements in WCPL are dynamic and can adapt to runtime conditions, enhancing flexibility in output generation.

### 3. **Functional Semantics**
   - Emphasis on functional programming concepts, allowing developers to write concise and expressive code.

### 4. **Semi-Hanging Indentation**
   - Unique semi-hanging indentation style for improved code readability and structure.

### 5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Easy setup and configuration with `installation.py` script for initializing project environments.

### 6. **Integration with Python**
   - Seamless integration with Python libraries and modules, leveraging Pythonâ€™s extensive ecosystem.

### 7. **Customizable Actions and Tasks**
   - Utilizes `start`/`stop` for managing actions, functions, tasks, or requests, enhancing control flow.

### 8. **Dependable Simulation**
   - Dynamic simulations that adjust to real-time changes, facilitating interactive development and testing.

### 9. **Expansion and Modularity**
   - Expandable through "deposits" (new features) and "withdraws" (forks), fostering continuous evolution.

### 10. **License and Dependency Management**
   - Utilizes the Modified QSRLC license by Joey Soprano 420 for clarity and flexibility in usage rights.

## Future Enhancements
